#         Technical details for the rpanel library

Installation
------------

To install using devtools to unload the current version:
      install("rpanel")
      
To install the old-fashioned way:
      install.packages("~/research/rpanel/rpanel/", repos = NULL, type = "source")

To install from GitHub:
		    library(devtools)
		    install_github("adrian-bowman/rpanel/rpanel")

To install from a terminal:  
      cd ~/research/rpanel
      R CMD INSTALL rpanel

R code to detach the current package and install a new one:
      detach(package:rpanel)
      unloadNamespace("rpanel")
      install.packages("~/research/rpanel/rpanel/", repos = NULL, type = "source")


Checking
--------

Update the history, ChangeLog, NAMESPACE, DESCRIPTION, rpanel.r (onAttach) 
CITATION and rpanel.package.Rd (date, version number, function names) files as required.

From the devtools package, use
      check("rpanel")

The old-fashioned checking procedure is invoked from a terminal by
      R CMD build rpanel
      R CMD CHECK --as-cran rpanel    
      
Check package dependencies
      R
      library(tools)
      check_packages_in_dir(".")

If data needs to be saved more efficiently, then this should be
      R CMD build --resave-data rpanel

A Windows binary version can be created by uploading this file to
      win-builder.r-project.org/
