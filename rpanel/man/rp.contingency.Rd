\title{Visualisation and testing of two-way contingency tables}

\description{
A two-way contingency table is displayed graphically and the uncertainties associated with a chi-squared test may be visualised.
}

\usage{
rp.contingency(x, style = 'mosaic', values = 'observed', uncertainty = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a two-way table or matrix of observed counts.}
\item{style}{a character value, either \code{'mosaic'} or \code{'separated'}, which determines the form of display.}
\item{values}{a character value, either \code{'observed'}, \code{'proportions'} or \code{'expected'}, which controls what is printed inside each cell of the display.}
\item{uncertainty}{a logical value which controls whether uncertainties associated with a chi-squared test are displayed for each cell.}
}

\details{
The table is displayed in a form which stratifies by columns. If it more appropriate to stratify by the rows of \code{x} then two options are available. One is to apply the function to \code{t(x)}. The other is to add the \code{ggplot} layer \code{ggplot2::coord_flip()} to the \code{ggplot} object returned by the function.

Missing data are not allowed.
}

\value{
A \code{ggplot} object is returned. This allows some features of the display to be modified, for example by adding a title.
