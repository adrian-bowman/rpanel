\title{Graphical display of linear models with no more than two explanatory variables}

\description{
This function is primarily intended to provide graphical representations of linear models with no more than two explanatory variables. These can be covariates or factors or a mixture of the two. When there are more than two explanatory variables the model is passed on to the \code{\link{rp.coefficients}} or \code{\link{rp.drop1}} functions.
}

\usage{
rp.lm(x, ylab, xlab, zlab, panel = TRUE, panel.plot = TRUE,
      style = 'ggplot', plot.nodes = FALSE,
      uncertainty.display = 'density', inference = 'coefficients',
      ci = TRUE, cols, display.model, comparison.model,
      residuals.showing, linewidth = 1,
      hscale = 1, vscale = hscale, ...)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{a formula defining the linear model or a fitted linear model object.}
\item{ylab, xlab, zlab}{character variables used for the axis labels.}
\item{panel}{a logical value which determines whether a panel is created to allow interactive control of the fitted models.}
\item{panel.plot}{a logical value which determines whether the plot is placed inside the panel (TRUE) or the standard graphics window (FALSE).}
\item{style}{a character variable determining whether \code{ggplot} graphics are used. Any value other than \code{'ggplot'} invokes an older form of the function with standard graphics. \code{ggplot} style is strongly recommended.}
\item{plot.nodes}{a logical value, relevant only when the function is called in non-interactive mode (\code{panel = FALSE}), which determines whether the lattice of model nodes is plotted or the plot of the data and fitted model is returned. In the latter case, the returned object is a \code{ggplot} object.}
\item{uncertainty.display}{a character value which determines whether the uncertainty display is in \code{'density'} or \code{'shading'} style.}
\item{inference}{a character value which determines whether the inference display is based on \code{'coefficients'} or \code{'terms'}.}
\item{ci}{a logical value which is passed to the \code{rp.coefficients} function when this is used to display model coefficients. When \code{ci} is set to \code{FALSE} uncertainty is placed around 0 in hypothesis test style.}
\item{cols}{a named character vector of colours to be used in constructing the display. See \code{help(rp.colours)} for details.}
\item{display.model}{a one sided formula which determines the specific model to be displayed. This can be a reduced model which omits some of the terms present in the model defined by \code{x}, or an expanded model which includes interaction terms.}
\item{comparison.model}{a one sided formula which determines the specific model to be compared with the displayed model. This can be a reduced model which omits some of the terms present in the model defined by \code{x} or, when at least one factore is present, an expanded model which includes an interaction term.}
\item{residuals.showing}{a logical value which determines whether residuals are displayed when there are two covariates.}
\item{linewidth}{a numerical value which sets the \code{linewidth} parameter in the case of one covariate and one factor.}
\item{hscale, vscale}{scaling parameters for the size of the plot when \code{panel.plot} is set to \code{TRUE}.  The default values are 1.}
\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{lm} when \code{x} is a formula rather than a fitted model.}
}

\details{
The display of the data is adapted to the form of the explanatory variables. When \code{panel = TRUE} a lattice of potential models is displayed in graphical form. When a node of the lattice is clicked the corresponding fitted model is displayed. When a connection between adjacent models is clicked, a comparison of the two adjacent models is displayed, either as model coefficients (\code{display = 'coefficients'}) or model terms (\code{display = 'coefficients'}).

When the model defined by \code{x} contains two explanatory variables, where at least one is a factor, the models which can be fitted include the interaction term, even where this is not explicitly included in \code{x}.

When there are exactly two covariates in \code{x}, the function will not consider an interaction between these, even when \code{x} includes this.

If \code{display.model} is not specified, its default setting is NULL when \code{panel = TRUE} and the model specified by \code{x} when \code{panel = FALSE}.

Missing data are removed before the linear models are fitted.
