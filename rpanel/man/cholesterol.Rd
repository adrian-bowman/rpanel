\title{Cholesterol and age for samples of women in Iowa and Nebraska}

\description{
Snedecor \& Cochran (1967) report a subsample of measurements from an early study of health and nutrition by Swanson et al. (1955), with a particular focus on cholesterol. Women were recruited from both Iowa and Nebraska and there is interest in whether there is any evidence of a systematic difference between the groups. If there is no evidence of a difference, the groups might reasonably be pooled. An upward trend in cholesterol with age is expected.

The \code{cholesterol} dataframe consists of three columns of data:
\itemize{
\item \code{Age}: age in years;
\item \code{Cholesterol}: cholesterol in mg / 100 ml;
\item \code{Location}: The state of residence, Iowa or Nebraska.
}
