	               Immediate changes to rpanel
--------------------------------------------------------------

rp.geosim
  - use fields package for simulation. RandomFields is no longer on CRAN.
    - what about the Matern parametrisaion issue mentioned in rp.geosim help?
    - change from exponential to Matern covariance.
    - pSill does nothing
    - anisotropy
  - variogram does not diplay.  Missing call to geoR for as.geodata function?
  - add the covariance function as an alternative to the variogram?

Passing values from the function arguments to the shiny app?  See the post at:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49470474/saving-r-shiny-app-as-a-function-with-arguments-passed-to-the-shiny-app
This uses shinyOptions.

rp.tables
  - add a vertical line at the appropriate value when using
    a fixed probability (as with p-values)?
  - the t density function doesn't go to zero for small df's.
  - construct a general distribution plotter, with controls added and
    curves added for each new selected distribution?
    Use a menu to select distributions.
  - create an alias rp.distributions?

rp.one/twosample
  - does this mean add a two-sample setting?
  - also add binomial proportions?

rp.regression
  - the specification of models is very inflexible in the one and two 
    covariate cases.  Can this be improved? See CoFE slides in the teaching
    material for an example.
  - display to show the significance of complete factors or covariates?
    Multiples of error variance?
  - glms: change the axis label to refer to 'linear predictor'.
  - mixed models?
  - allow different funtions to control the calculation of effect size?
    range, iqr, user-supplied?

rp.mururoa
  - error about figure margins if hspace left to default.  (Windows?)
   
rp.spacetime
  - allow regular data to be exploited, with marginal space and time input
    and a matrix of spacetime values.

rp.sample
  - allow binomial data to be specified.
    This needs a proportion instead of a mean, for both population and sample.
    The standard deviation is also irrelevant.
    Can this be done by changing the displayed guis?
  - the vertical location of 2 se in the sample mean plot seems rather high.

rp.contingency
  - integrate into the package rather than as a separate file.
   
rp.anova
  - use of transparency to compare reference density and observed, as in rp.contingency.
    Other functions which need this?
  - the model specifications are very messy.
    Use "interaction", "additive", etc. in some way?

rp.geosim
  - this has been changed to allow panel = FALSE but more extensive changes
    are required for consistency. Some thinking to be done here.
  - the help file also needs to be updated.

rp.power
  - notice the existence of power.t.test in R. This also allows the 
    identification of n from a given power. This could give more 
    flexibility to the rp.power function.

rp.plot4d:
  - example involving group in help file.
  - allow a function to control the plotting for the data inside the probe.
    Can/should aspects such as ylim be controllable here?  Easier not to in 
    the first instance.  This might work perfectly well for non-response
    data too (in which case the radiobuttons for histogram and density 
    might be removed?).
  - provide an argument which defines a function to be used to create the 
    location plot, with default function(x, y) points(x, y).
  - allow axes to be suppressed (for example for map plotting).
    In fact, more general plotting control parameters might be passed by ....
  - change l in hcl rather than s in hsv, to avoid grey points when a
    normal window is used.

rp.logistic:
  - binomial example
  
rp.curve:
  - create this to match rp.surface?  Animate (linear regression) until a 
    request to stop, with other forms of display including density shading.
    uncertainty-sm1.r in India files - strange behaviour in trying to call
    a function repeatedly.

	               Issues relevant to the tcltk material
--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuart Jones: e-mail 27.08.13
First, thank you so much for developing rpanel. It is a really great tool.  In my use of the package I've noticed one little bug that turns out to be quite bothersome in some applications.  This has to do with the slider widget. Because the action function is called on movement of the slider, rather than release of the mouse button or movement and mouse button release, there is a lag in updating of a graph that is dependent on a slider.  Are you actively maintaining or updating rpanel in any way? Would this be an easy fix or fairly difficult?

See errors reported by Megan: research/rpanel/megan/Rpanel Report/rpanel 1.1-3 errors

Is this still a problem?
Communication from level 2.  See the rp.sample (new) cartoon and the passing of display and display.old.  Stripped down version could help to isolate the problem.

A function to create R-Shiny code in simple cases?

rp.text: 
 - this is centred.  More flexibility?

Probably OK to remove all the statements of type:
  if (!exists(panel$panelname, .rpenv, inherits = FALSE))
    panelname <- deparse(substitute(panel))
  else 
    panelname <- panel$panelname

randomfields package is due to change at the end of Nov. 2013.  
This may require changes to rp.geosim, rp.mururoa and rp.firth.

rp.table: 
 - code exists but this is not yet tested.
 - what does this do?  Example doesn't seem to work properly.
 
rp.notebook
  - using rp.regression within a notebook (draft for Megan)
  - extension to other functions
  
Use global variables in rp.cartoons to set hscale and vscale, so the user can adjust this through a doublebutton or slider when using the functions live.

The new hostpanel system (project with Megan) should really keep the information required by the inserted function in a separate place from the main panel, otherwise there is the risk of name conflicts with panel items.

Use globalVariables() to stop the messages about global bindings when the package is checked.  See the code at the foot of the utilities.r file in the sm package for an example of how to do this.

The set up of a panel can be very jittery, presumably because of handshaking.  For example:
   data(CofE)
   attach(CofE)
   rp.regression(Employ, Giving)
This may partly be due to the addition of individual items in a radiogroup etc.
Is there a `hide' mechanism which could help, with the panel appearing once everything is in place?

If the higher level rp functions (rp.anova etc.) are used repeatedly, the windows become slow to disappear when they are closed.  Is there any issue about memory building up?

I've had a go at creating an rp.checkbox.change function.  There are one or two things I can't do and which I need to ask you.  Where is the varname and the action function to be found?  At the moment I have to pass them again as arguments.  See test-rp-ancova.r.  The presence of the overall mean is not corrected properly.
If this works, it should probably be transferred to rp-anova.r too.

Replace rp.control.put by rp.update(panel) which simply calls 
the equivalent of rp.control.put(panel$panelname, panel)?  I can do this.
(There is a possibility of being in the wrong environment.)

Check that the panel is returned by the action function and report if it isn't.  This is very helpful to users.

Consider a demo.  Does this suffer from the same ask=TRUE problem as example?

rp.mururoa, rp.firth:
  - put in a yes/no dialogue box when the `Take sample' button is pressed,
    to confirm that this is a once-only opportunity.

rp.surface:
 - rgl option

Can we change the fontsize in rp.text?  (rp.plot4d)  Not at the moment.

Homer cartoon.  How to create a button-launched video?

Can the positions and values of controls be set by command?
For example, it could be useful to set a slider in reaction to
some other gui.

Tab facility
   Create a sampling tool, which contains rp.correlation, rp.sample etc.
   as separate tabs?
   
Create a Help button which can launch the help page for the application.
   See rp.mururoa.  The help page needs to be called at the global level
   which is problematic in standard rpanel operations.
   More flexible options?

Layout issues:
   Trap and handle mixtures of presence and absence of row and column
      specification in all functions.  (Grid and other layouts cannot
      be mixed.)
   Bounding boxes
      - rp.checkbox, rp.textentry: no box by default but optional
      - rp.radiogroup: box by default but option to remove

Allow other types of graphic files (not just gif) in rp.image.

rp.textentry keeps re-entering a clicked box as character
once is has been changed.  (The cursor is still clicking
there.)  It would also be good to have the option to force
the entered text to be numeric. 
(gamm.r in teaching/inference/scripts)

Could the draw/redraw scheme of things allow the same code
to be written but draw or redraw invoked by some automatic
means?  See tables.r for repeated code, with only draw/redraw
different in the action functions.
Should the .draw/.redraw convention be forced?

It would be useful to have an rp.lines function which does the
same as lines in R.  Also rp.points (and rp.segments).
