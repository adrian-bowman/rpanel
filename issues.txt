	               Immediate changes to rpanel
--------------------------------------------------------------

Create testthat style of tests for all functions.

rp.t_test
  - two-sample case: zoom
      - axis (zoom) accounts for two-sided test even when mu is not specified?
      - the ruler is much larger in the zoom case
      - the range needs to be fixed
      - the reference value disappears although it is still in the legend
  - two-sample case: the p-value details are rather cramped.
  - two-sample case: the names of the two groups are reduced to x and y?
    rp.t_test(caged, electrified, uncertainty = 'sample mean', panel = FALSE)
  - trap group size 1 as an error. Remove the nmin code?
  - rp.t_test(sleep_diff, panel = FALSE, ruler.position = 'reference')
    this gives feedback but also gives an error and prints the t-test results.

rp.sample
  - warnings about missing values: see tests.
  - improve the plots created by standard graphics, when ggplot = FALSE,
    to match those when ggplot = TRUE. Is it worth it?
    (ggplot = FALSE not currenty activated)
  - remove nbins for the data in the binomial case.

rp.datalink
  - regular systematic checks needed on availability of datasets
  - remove references to www.stats.gla.ac.uk
  - problem with Ben Nevis data: see https://www.ceda.ac.uk. Data not yet restored
    after an incident.
  
rp.colour.key
  - allow cex.axis to be changed in rp.colour.key.
    See the code in rp_colour_key.R in the rental sector paper analysis.

rp.geosim
  - the variogram plot no longer disappears when the checkboxes are not checked.
  - display the values of the anisotropy parameters in the plot title.
  - this has been changed to allow panel = FALSE but more extensive changes
    are required for consistency. Some thinking to be done here.
  - the help file also needs to be updated.
  - add range = 0.

rp.likelihood: 2 variable case
   - neaten up the edges of the 3d surface
   - is transparency ok on Windows?

rp.plot3d
  - allow a factor (or character variable) to be passed in the col or size argument.
    This avoids the need to create a specific colour variable to pass in.
    Where would the legend be placed?

rp.plot4d:
  - check for Windows OS and, if so, force a uniform window rather
    than a normal one, as Windows doesn't support transparency.
    ggplot solution?
  - change l in hcl rather than s in hsv, to avoid grey points when a
    normal window is used.
  - example involving group in help file.
  - allow a function to control the plotting for the data inside the probe.
    Can/should aspects such as ylim be controllable here?  Easier not to in 
    the first instance.  This might work perfectly well for non-response
    data too (in which case the radiobuttons for histogram and density 
    might be removed?).
  - provide an argument which defines a function to be used to create the 
    location plot, with default function(x, y) points(x, y).
  - allow axes to be suppressed (for example for map plotting).
    In fact, more general plotting control parameters might be passed by ....
    
rp.tables
  - add a vertical line at the appropriate value when using
    a fixed probability (as with p-values)?
  - the t density function doesn't go to zero for small df's.

rp.mururoa
  - errors in contour levels for linear and quadratic predictions
   
rp.power
  - rp.power(panel = FALSE, populations.showing = TRUE)
    Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors

rp.radiogroup
  - the reference to 'not implemented' in the vals section of the help file is a bit confusing.
  
Remove keywords from help files?

Rename the colour names? Extend to 'residuals'. Also in help files.

--------------------------------------------------------------
	               Ideas for changes to rpanel
--------------------------------------------------------------

Can windows be manually adjusted as in tkRplotR?

Add a data argument to functions.

rp.lm
  - the cols argument needs to be cascaded down to the specialist function for different data types.

rp.coefficients
  - allow different functions to control the display of coefficients?
    range, iqr, user-supplied?
  - lines idea to give visual cues? (change in mean versus change from min(x))
    This needs some thinking.

rp.drop1
  - extend this to glms.

rp.contingency
  - allow observed and expected values to be displayed together.
    rp.contingency(x, values = c('observed', 'expected'))
    Also observed and expected proportions.
  - allow contributions to chi-squared statistic to be displayed? See mosaicplot shading.
  - change the cell fill colours with an added scale_discrete_manual layer?
  - activate style = 'proportions', with a plot similar to rp.anova and with violins?

rp.spacetime
  - allow regular data to be exploited, with marginal space and time input
    and a matrix of spacetime values.

rp.tables
  - construct a general distribution plotter, with controls added and
    curves added for each new selected distribution?
    Use a menu to select distributions.
  - create an alias rp.distributions?

rp.power
  - notice the existence of power.t.test in R. This also allows the 
    identification of n from a given power. This could give more 
    flexibility to the rp.power function.

rp.logistic:
  - add a binomial example
  
rp.curve:
  - create this to match rp.surface?  Animate (linear regression) until a 
    request to stop, with other forms of display including density shading.
    uncertainty-sm1.r in India files - strange behaviour in trying to call
    a function repeatedly.

rp.control.dispose
  - deal with the case where the panel object does not exist.
  
rp.slider
  - problem with reported ~09.01.19.
    See e-mail and test code from Cecil Barnett-Neefs.

	               Issues relevant to the tcltk material
--------------------------------------------------------------

Stuart Jones: e-mail 27.08.13
First, thank you so much for developing rpanel. It is a really great tool.  In my use of the package I've noticed one little bug that turns out to be quite bothersome in some applications.  This has to do with the slider widget. Because the action function is called on movement of the slider, rather than release of the mouse button or movement and mouse button release, there is a lag in updating of a graph that is dependent on a slider.  Are you actively maintaining or updating rpanel in any way? Would this be an easy fix or fairly difficult?

See errors reported by Megan: research/rpanel/megan/Rpanel Report/rpanel 1.1-3 errors

Is this still a problem?
Communication from level 2.  See the rp.sample (new) cartoon and the passing of display and display.old.  Stripped down version could help to isolate the problem.

A function to create R-Shiny code in simple cases?

rp.text: 
 - this is centred.  More flexibility?

Probably OK to remove all the statements of type:
  if (!exists(panel$panelname, .rpenv, inherits = FALSE))
    panelname <- deparse(substitute(panel))
  else 
    panelname <- panel$panelname

randomfields package is due to change at the end of Nov. 2013.  
This may require changes to rp.geosim, rp.mururoa and rp.firth.

rp.table: 
 - code exists but this is not yet tested.
 - what does this do?  Example doesn't seem to work properly.
 
rp.notebook
  - using rp.regression within a notebook (draft for Megan)
  - extension to other functions
  
Use global variables in rp.cartoons to set hscale and vscale, so the user can adjust this through a doublebutton or slider when using the functions live.

The new hostpanel system (project with Megan) should really keep the information required by the inserted function in a separate place from the main panel, otherwise there is the risk of name conflicts with panel items.

Use globalVariables() to stop the messages about global bindings when the package is checked.  See the code at the foot of the utilities.r file in the sm package for an example of how to do this.

The set up of a panel can be very jittery, presumably because of handshaking.  For example:
   data(CofE)
   attach(CofE)
   rp.regression(Employ, Giving)
This may partly be due to the addition of individual items in a radiogroup etc.
Is there a `hide' mechanism which could help, with the panel appearing once everything is in place?

If the higher level rp functions (rp.anova etc.) are used repeatedly, the windows become slow to disappear when they are closed.  Is there any issue about memory building up?

I've had a go at creating an rp.checkbox.change function.  There are one or two things I can't do and which I need to ask you.  Where is the varname and the action function to be found?  At the moment I have to pass them again as arguments.  See test-rp-ancova.r.  The presence of the overall mean is not corrected properly.
If this works, it should probably be transferred to rp-anova.r too.

Replace rp.control.put by rp.update(panel) which simply calls 
the equivalent of rp.control.put(panel$panelname, panel)?  I can do this.
(There is a possibility of being in the wrong environment.)

Check that the panel is returned by the action function and report if it isn't.  This is very helpful to users.

Consider a demo.  Does this suffer from the same ask=TRUE problem as example?

rp.mururoa, rp.firth:
  - put in a yes/no dialogue box when the `Take sample' button is pressed,
    to confirm that this is a once-only opportunity.

rp.surface:
 - rgl option

Can we change the fontsize in rp.text?  (rp.plot4d)  Not at the moment.

Homer cartoon.  How to create a button-launched video?

Can the positions and values of controls be set by command?
For example, it could be useful to set a slider in reaction to
some other gui.

Tab facility
   Create a sampling tool, which contains rp.correlation, rp.sample etc.
   as separate tabs?
   
Create a Help button which can launch the help page for the application.
   See rp.mururoa.  The help page needs to be called at the global level
   which is problematic in standard rpanel operations.
   More flexible options?

Layout issues:
   Trap and handle mixtures of presence and absence of row and column
      specification in all functions.  (Grid and other layouts cannot
      be mixed.)
   Bounding boxes
      - rp.checkbox, rp.textentry: no box by default but optional
      - rp.radiogroup: box by default but option to remove

Allow other types of graphic files (not just gif) in rp.image.

rp.textentry keeps re-entering a clicked box as character
once is has been changed.  (The cursor is still clicking
there.)  It would also be good to have the option to force
the entered text to be numeric. 
(gamm.r in teaching/inference/scripts)

Could the draw/redraw scheme of things allow the same code
to be written but draw or redraw invoked by some automatic
means?  See tables.r for repeated code, with only draw/redraw
different in the action functions.
Should the .draw/.redraw convention be forced?

It would be useful to have an rp.lines function which does the
same as lines in R.  Also rp.points (and rp.segments).
