Dear 

Thanks for your e-mail.  The root of the problem is that, annoyingly, an additional Tcl file called BWidget is need to run panel but this is not now routinely distributed with the main TCL package on a Mac.  (It is on Windows.)  I have given the instructions below to install BWidget on your machine.  Panel should then install without difficulty.

Let me know how you get on.

Best wishes,

Adrian


Download BWidget from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib/files/BWidget/ and expand the compressed file into a folder.  On a Windows machine, this folder should then be copied into the folder containing the Tcl libraries that were installed as part of R.  This may be in a location such as C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.2\Tcl\lib (with an obvious change to the version number of R being used).  On a Mac, the downloaded folder should be copied into the folder where the main Tcl package is located.  This should be in a location such as /usr/local/lib.
